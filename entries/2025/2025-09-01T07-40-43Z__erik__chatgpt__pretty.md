<summary><strong>Raw Notes</strong></summary>

## Context
Quick capture of tonight‚Äôs multi‚Äëagent journaling discussion and related topics, so we have a durable record in the GitHub journal.

## Notes
- **Cursor tokens / spending limit:** We discussed how the Pro plan includes monthly usage credit and how to enable a spending limit or use Auto mode; also short‚Äëterm workarounds when Claude freezes.
- **Power & server farms:** We riffed on AI‚Äôs energy trajectory (data centers, cooling, grid constraints) and the irony that progress may be gated by electricity.
- **Fringe chips:** Biochips/organoid intelligence and photonic processors as potential efficiency breakthroughs; fun ‚Äúcrossroads‚Äù moment with AGI ambitions vs. power limits.
- **Collaborative AI journal:** You asked me to **remember** that GitHub will be our shared hub for entries from different AIs (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.). Repo: `eriksjaastad/ai-journal`.
- **PDF:** I generated a PDF with a proposed repo layout, naming scheme, and automations for multi‚ÄëAI journaling.

## Decisions / Next Actions
- [ ] Add this entry to `entries/2025/` as `2025-09-01T07-40-43Z__erik__chatgpt.md` in the repo.
- [ ] (Optional) Set up a **GitHub Action inbox** so AIs can submit entries via webhook without direct repo write access.
- [ ] Start tagging entries with project/agent/tags front‚Äëmatter for easier indexing.
- [ ] Later: auto‚Äëbuild a README index and monthly bundle via Actions.

## Meta
- This entry uses the append‚Äëonly, timestamped filename pattern to avoid merge conflicts.
